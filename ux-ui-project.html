        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Work with Me</em> is a social app that allows users who want to go to the gym with a partner or group to connect and coordinate with others who share the same goal. Along with my 2 teammates, I share the role of user experience and interface designer for the app, which is currently still in development.</p>

      <div class="box-col1">
        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>The app is designed to bring together gym enthusiasts who struggle to find others to workout with using a scheduling and user messaging system. In the process of determining features, I participated in user research to learn more about our target audience and understand what drives them to go to the gym.</p>
        <p>These interviews opened up insightful discussions regarding personal fitness goals, motivations, workout activities, and pain points, which gave us a good initial sample to represent our demographic and outline a feature plan.</p>

        <h2>UX Design</h2>
        <p>When it came to designing the UX and interaction, our team held brainstorming sessions to visualize our app's layout in relation to task flows. Using the personas we created, I also designed the experience map we needed to better understand how we want our users to go through the process of scheduling a workout and connecting with others.</p>

      <div class="box-col1">
        <h2>Interaction</h2>
        <p>Currently, we are continuing our exploration of interaction and how we could best support the social needs of our intended users. Our primary focus is to make the act of scheduling a workout as quick and seamless as possible so that the task can easily be repeated as needed.</p>
        <p>For this stage, I've created interactive wireframes of our core feature's UI to explore animation styles and content hierarchy.</p>
